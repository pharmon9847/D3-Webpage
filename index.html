          <h2>The 2014 U.S. ACS 1-Year Estimates Report Shows the Health Risks Facing Different Demographics</h2>
          <p>To see different data relationships, SELECT from the HEADINGS: Poverty, Age, Household Income, Obesity,
             Smokers, and Without Healthcare. Each selection CHANGES the State data represented in circles on the graph.
             The small circles can then be SELECTED or HOVERED OVER to view the specific values for that state.  </p>

          <p>There are three groups of data relationships on this graph, each showing powerful correlations. The first
            group is the "Percent in Poverty" demographic as it relates to three distinct risk factors: (a) percentage  
            of obesity, (b) percentage of smokers, and (c) percentage without healthcare. The second group is the "Median Age"
            demographic as it relates to to three distinct risk factors: (a) percentage of obesity, (b) percentage of
            smokers, and (c) percentage without healthcare. The third group is the "Median Household Income" demographic
            as it relates to three distinct risk factors: (a) percentage of obesity, (b) percentage of smokers, and (c)
            percentage without healthcare.  </p>
